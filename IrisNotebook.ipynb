    "\n",
    "Tensorflow is a popular software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. Tensorflow is open-source and is developed by the Google Brain Team. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library and is also used for machine learning applications such as neaural networks [1]. I will be using Tensorflow's Python API but it is available for a range of languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python developed by a Google engineer: Francois Chollet. Keras acts like a \"library on top of a library\" as it is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. Keras takes the functionality in core Tensorflow and adds a higher-level of abstraction to it, making it easier to experiment with deep neaural networks [2].\n"
