Keras acts like a \"library on top of a library\" as it is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano. Keras takes the functionality in core Tensorflow and adds a higher-level of abstraction to it, making it easier to experiment with deep neural networks [2].\n"

    "A multi-class classification is a classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears. Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label: a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time [4].\n",

    "#### What is a multi-label classification?\n",
    "A multi-label classification assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive, such as topics that are relevant for a document. A text might be about any of religion, politics, finance or education at the same time or none of these [4].\n",
    "\n",

    "I could use a categorical or binary cross entropy - categorical tackles a multi-class problem while binary tackles a multi-label problem. The Iris problem is a multi-class problem (An Iris can either be setosa, virginica or versicolor), hence why I need to use categorical cross entropy when calculating the loss.\n",
