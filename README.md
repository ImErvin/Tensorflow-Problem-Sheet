## Tensorflow Problem Sheet
This is a simple MNIST problem sheet. The aim of this problem sheet is to get a foot in the door and start learning about deep learning. This problem sheet was created by [Ian Mcloughlin](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin) as part of our emerging technologies module in college.

You can find my solutions to each of these problems in this repository.

### Problem Sheet Questions

**1. Use Tensorflow to create model**

	Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.
**2. Split the data into training and testing**
	
	Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. 
    You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. 
    If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.
**3. Train the model**
	
	Use the testing set to train your model.

**4. Test the model**
    
    Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
